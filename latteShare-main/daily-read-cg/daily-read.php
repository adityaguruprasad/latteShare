<h3>Why you should start studying for your exams at the nearest coffee shop</h3>
    Exams are coming. Yes, they are closer than you think. This is the first sign to start studying! But the real question is where to study and how to study. Did it ever happen to you to go to your library and you couldn’t find any place? Well, it happened to me. The library was so crowded that there was no available chair. I had to sit in the hall and to study there. From 12 am to 06 am I was studying on a chair in the hall (happily this story got a great ending — I passed my exam). But suddenly, I came up with a great idea. Why not to study at my local coffee shop?

    You need to use the natural light! Yes, it is definitely better to study outside. You know that no light can replace the natural light. It has been proven that the natural light help people to be more productive and happier. Beside the light, you are going to breath the outside air which will bring freshness to your ambient, it will help you to clear your mind and learn things in the right way.</div><br><br>

<div class="more">You cannot procrastinate at a coffee shop! I think that this is the best thing about studying in a coffee shop. You cannot decide to go to the kitchen, looking for something to eat, you cannot turn your TV on because you don’t have one. We always do everything else instead of studying. There were times when I my room was the cleanest place ever because my exams were coming. Sad but true.</div>
